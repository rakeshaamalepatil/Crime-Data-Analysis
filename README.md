Crime Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of crime data, designed to transform raw information into clear and interactive dashboards. Using Tableau, I focused on identifying key trends, patterns, and insights to help law enforcement and urban planners better understand crime dynamics.

The analysis is broken down into four key areas:

Overall Crime Dashboard: A high-level view of total crime counts, common crime types, and geographical distribution.

Time Period Analysis: Insights into when crimes occur, examining trends by day of the week and time of day.

Trend Analysis: A look at crime trends over time, comparing year-by-year data to identify long-term patterns.

Specific Incident Analysis: A deeper dive into specific crime types, including arrest rates and domestic incident statistics.

Project Deliverables
The project deliverables are interactive dashboards created in Tableau. These dashboards are designed for easy, real-time exploration of the data. Key features include:

Interactive Filters: You can filter the data by crime type, date range, and other variables to focus on specific information.

Visualizations: The dashboards feature a variety of charts, including bar charts, line graphs, and geographical maps, to present data in an easily digestible format.

Key Metrics: Important metrics like total crime count are highlighted for quick reference.

Technical Details
Tools Used
Tableau: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.

Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets: (Implied) Used for initial data cleaning and preparation.

Tableau Calculations
The analysis required custom calculated fields to derive specific insights. Key calculations include:

Arrest Rate: A formula to determine the percentage of crimes that resulted in an arrest.

Day Time: A conditional field to categorize crime times into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night.

About the Data
The data used for this project is from [Insert Data Source, e.g., Chicago Data Portal]. The dataset includes information on crime types, locations, dates, and whether an arrest was made.

Note: This project was created for educational purposes to demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills.
